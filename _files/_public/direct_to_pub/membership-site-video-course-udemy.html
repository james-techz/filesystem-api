<p> {!name_fix} - Create &quot;Udemy&quot; Sites with HD Videos - in 7 Minutes</p>
<p>{!name_fix},</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever wanted to sell your own  products... on your own membership site?</strong></p>
<p>Well, imagine if you could create <u>Udemy-like sites &amp; funnels</u> - selling HD Video Courses - in minutes:</p>
<h2><a href="https://site.com">Click Here - Create Your Own &quot;Udemy&quot; Sites - in 7 Minutes</a><br>
</h2>
<p>Now, selling your own products is &quot;the next step up&quot; from being an affiliate...</p>
<p><em>Higher profit margins, build your own customer list, unlimited potential...</em></p>
<p><strong>But, it can also be hard to set up your own membership site:</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Creating products - or finding a quality product to sell in the first place</p>
<p>&#8226; Setting up membership sites (with techie expensive software)</p>
<p>&#8226; Integrating payment gateways (with Paypal, APIs, etc)</p>
<p>&#8226; Delivering the product to buyers (with auto-email logins)</p>
<p>&#8226; Setting up the &quot;techie stuff&quot; (like hosting, ticket systems, etc)</p>
<p>In fact, product fulfillment is one of the most technically challenging steps of the whole process!</p>
<p>So is selling your own info product worth the headache? Well, short answer: <u>YES</u>...</p>
<p><strong>After all, I've made six to seven figures every year, selling my own  courses...</strong></p>
