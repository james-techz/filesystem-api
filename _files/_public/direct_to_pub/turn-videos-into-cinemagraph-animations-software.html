<p>NAME, Turn ANY YouTube&#8482; Video into &quot;Animations&quot; - for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn &amp; Instagram </p>
<p>NAME,</p>
<p><strong>Want to get more <u>FREE</u> traffic - from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest &amp; LinkedIn?</strong></p>
<p>Well, if you're using <u>ANY</u> of these sites, a new &quot;YouTube to flicks&quot; software will <u>EXPLODE</u> your results:</p>
<h2><a href="https://site.com">Click Here - Get More Leads &amp; Buyers with NEW &quot;Hybrid Animation&quot; Software</a><br>
  Act now (and keep reading for my $297  bonus package)
</h2>
<p>See, if you're marketing online, you need to grab people's attention.</p>
<p>Otherwise they'll skip  your Facebook post, ignore your image - or close your <strong>Instagram</strong>...</p>
<p><em>Don't grab their attention? You're leaving free traffic on the table every time you post!</em><em></em></p>
<p><strong>So how do you grab their attention and suck in more clicks? </strong></p>
<p>Well, that's where a new software that launched, <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a> comes in (price discount ends later today).</p>
<p><strong>ProductName turns <u>ANY</u> YouTube video into eye-catching &quot;animations&quot; (video/GIF/image &quot;hybrids&quot;)..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then it auto-posts &amp; schedules these traffic-getting &quot;animations&quot;... to  get you free clicks:</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Quickly creates professional eye-popping &quot;animations&quot; from any Youtube video (in 46 seconds!)</p>
<p>&#8226; Then, publish, schedule &amp; broadcast these to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube &amp; LinkedIn</p>
<p>&#8226; This gets you extra free traffic  from all your social media sites (reach <u>2.4 billion</u> people with no extra work)</p>
<p>&#8226; All in one tool with no  graphical skills, outsourcers or extra costs (like stock photos) needed</p>
<p><strong>Watch the 3 minute demo about half way down the page <a href="https://site.com">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>It's a great software package,  so I've created an awesome $297 value bonus package...</p>
<h2>ProductName  - Your $297 Bonus Offer</h2>
<p>Simply <a href="https://site.com">click here</a> and order ProductName (before the price increases in a few hours).</p>
<p>As well as the core software, you'll get instant access to all of this:</p>
<p>InsertBonuses</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to hold this bonus pack forever, but much of it is from  the creators of <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a>.</p>
<p><strong>They've allowed me to guarantee access to all these bonuses <u>until midnight Eastern tonight</u> (about 12 hours).</strong></p>
<p>After that, it depends on how many we have sold (and we expect these to sell very quickly).</p>
<p><strong>Oh.. and remember that the price of ProductName increases forever - later tonight...</strong></p>
<p>OK, so here's how you can claim your $297 Bonus Pack and start getting free traffic automatically with visual content:</p>
<h2><a href="https://site.com">Click Here to Turn Any YouTube video into &quot;Animations&quot; &amp; Get More Traffic From Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram &amp; LinkedIn</a><br>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>P.P.S. If you already use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn, you'll definitely want to <a href="https://site.com">watch this video</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any kind of presence on <u>any of these sites</u>, but don't regularly post visually engaging content, <em>you're leaving traffic on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>With ProductName, you can turn ANY YouTube video into these incredibly eye-catching &quot;flick&quot; images...</strong></p>
<p>And - because this is an all-in-one automated creation + posting solution -  there's <u>zero</u> techie headaches.</p>
