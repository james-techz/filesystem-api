<p>{!name_fix} - Get $25k + 8k Subscribers  ...with This &quot;Secret&quot; + NEW Video Traffic</p>
<p>{!name_fix},</p>
<p><strong>Want to tap into a <u>secret video traffic</u> portal... with 26 million daily viewers...</strong></p>
<p><strong>That generates $<u>24k</u> and 184k leads.. by <u>automatically</u> sharing <em>other people's</em> videos?</strong></p>
<h2><a href="https://site.com">Click Here - Tap Into This &quot;Secret Video Traffic&quot; Network &amp; Get 8,547 Subscribers</a><br>
  This page exposes a <u>NEW</u> video traffic network you've probably <u>never</u> thought of <br>
</h2>
<p>Imagine if you discovered a <u>secret video traffic source</u>, used by Netflix, YouTube &amp; Disney...</p>
<p>A secret site they use  to rake in <u>millions of video views</u> - without any <em>real competition</em>.. Plus..</p>
<p><strong>Imagine if someone showed you a &quot;secret software&quot; that gets you 137k subscribers... all by using other people's videos...</strong></p>
<p>So you could just pick a niche (with low competition),  a niche that's <u>already getting traffic</u>...</p>
<p><strong>Then,  <u>setup a quick channel</u> &amp; siphon off  thousands of <u>free</u>, targeted views, clicks and subscribers from this secret platform?</strong></p>
<p>Well, today, that &quot;secret method&quot; is here - and it's called <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a> (price increases later today)</p>
<p>Now it's a pretty insane claim to make - &quot;target a huge secret video traffic source&quot; - but how does it work? Well...</p>
<p><strong>ProductName lets you dominate Roku, the TV subscription service with over 26 million subscribers...</strong></p>
<p>Simply choose a niche for your channel (with hungry buyers, ad impressions and affiliate offers to promote)...</p>
<p><strong>Then, use the ProductName software to create your own Roku channel, filled with other people's Vimeo videos</strong></p>
<p>And start tapping into millions of hungry viewers that nobody else even knew existed... in hours!</p>
<p>It's nuts!  I love this  (check out the <a href="https://site.com">7 minute demo</a>) - in fact, I'm angry I didn't think of it myself!</p>
<p><strong>Now, ProductName has only just gone live, but the price increases in just a few hours...</strong></p>
<p>So join below, and you will get instant access to  the bonuses, and of course, ProductName, right away.</p>
