<p><strong>Here's a quick FAQ on the most common questions...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>What is ProductName?<br>
  <strong>A: </strong>A new software that lets <u>anyone</u> profit - by <u>automatically sharing</u> Vimeo videos on Roku - for instant <u>free</u> traffic.</p>
<p>It's a really clever tool, and here's how it works... everyone knows about video subscription services like Netflix,<br>
  &amp; one of the biggest is   Roku, with over <u>26 million</u> subscribers. There are huge channels on there  like <br>
Disney&amp; ESPN, but  few people know that &quot;average people&quot; can create a channel of their own...</p>
<p>But, there are <u> 2 problems</u> with this - creating content &amp; the technical process of setting up the channel).. </p>
<p><strong>And that's where TVBoss comes in -- to let <u>ANYONE</u> plug into this &quot;free video traffic&quot; source...</strong></p>
<p>ProductName lets you <u>automatically</u> create a Roku channel, pre-filled with <u>other people's</u> Vimeo videos. So you can<br>
  target a niche (even one you know nothing about - eg. dog training), build a huge subscriber base, and then<br>
<u>monetize</u> with ads, affiliate offers, ecommerce promotions etc. <u>Genius</u>... 100% legal... and <u>very</u> low competition!</p>
