<p>{!name_fix},</p>
<p> <strong>I <em>wish</em> I'd thought of this...</strong></p>
<p>My buddy Igor B  just released a new software - <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It's a <u> new website builder</u>... for   affiliates... but with a TWIST!</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Simply launch the software and you get a DFY affiliate website, so you can...</p>
<p>&#8226; Start   generating  commissions from <u>Amazon, JCPenney, Reebok, AT&amp;T &amp; 6,500 other  famous brands</u>...</p>
<p><strong>BUT -- here's where what makes this tool <u>so  special</u>...</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<h2><strong>  ProductName Is <u><em>ALL</em></u> About Promoting <u><em>Coupons &amp; Deals</em></u> Which = Insane Conversions</strong></h2>
<p>This is the exact same <u>PROVEN</u> method used by companies like Groupon &amp; Retailmenot. </p>
<p>Rather than try to <em>convince</em> people to buy a product...</p>
<p>You simply <u>insert</u> yourself at the last minute and &quot;swipe&quot; your commission on the checkout page!</p>
<p> <strong>People search for &quot;product name + coupon&quot; <u>just before they buy</u> - so you get FREE <u> buyer traffic that's insanely targeted.</u></strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Are people searching for 1000s of these products daily? <u>Heck yes</u>.</p>
<p>&#8226; Are these searches insanely targeted (think $5+ per click)? <u>Yes</u>.</p>
<p>&#8226; Is competition low for these keywords? <u>Absolutely</u>.</p>
<p>So here's the main takeaway...</p>
<p>...</p>
<h2><u>You've just inserted your affiliate link</u> seconds before the person buys </h2>
<p>And... you can do it for Amazon &amp; 6,500 other major brands!</p>
<p><strong>And get this - for most brands your affiliate cookie lasts beyond that session...</strong></p>
<p><strong>So when they return back to Amazon etc, in 24 hours (like everyone does) and buy something - anything - you get a commission.</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the great things with this angle - <u>you cheekily come in at the last second, get paid for that... </u></p>
<p><u>And then also get paid for other products too</u> (not <em>just</em> the offer you promoted).</p>
<p>Getting traffic &amp; &quot;finding buyers&quot; was always the tricky part of being an Amazon affiliate, but now...</p>
<p><strong>This new website builder does all of this automatically. </strong></p>
<p><strong>And with daily coupons added, you don't even need to worry about content generation!</strong></p>
<p>You can check out a demo of the site, and a full explanation of how this clever new method works here:</p>

</h2>
<p>Oh, and one more thing...</p>
<p>It's a great software tool,  so I've created an awesome $197 value bonus package...</p>
<h2>ProductName - Your $197 Bonus Offer</h2>
<p>Simply <a href="https://site.com">click here</a> and order ProductName (before the price increase  tonight).</p>
<p>As well as the core software (which is discounted this week only), you'll get instant access to all of this:</p>
<p>InsertBonuses<br>
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to hold this bonus pack forever, but it's mostly from Igor, the creator of <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a>.</p>
<p><strong>He's allowed me to guarantee access to all these bonuses <u>until midnight Eastern tonight</u>.</strong></p>
<p>After that, it depends on how many we have sold (and we expect these to sell very quickly).</p>
<p>OK, so here's how you can claim your $197 Bonus Pack and build your first &quot;coupons + deals&quot; Amazon Affiliate Site:</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>YOURNAME
</p>
<p>P.S. I'm loving this idea - &quot;Deals + Amazon + Google = Buyer Commissions&quot;. Clever</p>
<p>But be aware that the price of ProductName increases every few hours...</p>
<p>So you have a short window to <a href="https://site.com">start getting Amazon commissions &amp; Google buyer traffic with coupon sites!</a><br>
