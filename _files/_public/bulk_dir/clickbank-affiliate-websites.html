<p>â¢ Having to create a &quot;bonus&quot; that you can give away (very expensive!)</p>
<p>So is affiliate marketing worth the headache? Well, short answer: <u>YES</u>...</p>
<p>After all, I've <u>six</u> figures <u>every</u> year as an affiliate (for almost a decade!)...</p>
<p><strong>I even know one guy pulling in <u>five  figures a DAY</u> as an affiliate.</strong></p>
