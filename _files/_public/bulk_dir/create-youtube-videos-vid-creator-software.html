<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is ProductName?<br>

  get <u>free traffic</u> from YouTube and SEO... so you can rank for <u>BUYER KEYWORDS</u> on day 1...</p>
<p><u><strong>PLUS</strong></u><strong>, I took the liberty of pre-loading the software with <u>$15</u>k of scripts, voice overs,<br>
  affiliate programs, niches &amp; YouTube keywords - which you can access instantly!
</strong></p>
<p>That way you can choose a website or affiliate program... create a video... and get traffic on day 1!</p>

  you&quot; in this all-in-one <u>video+affiliate</u> software tool..</p>

  video on your chosen buyer keywords. It's ALL done for you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Who will benefit from ProductName?<br>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How long will the software be available for?<br>
  <strong>A: </strong>The software stays open until Sunday. But the price increases <u>tonight</u> (tonight Tuesday... and <em>again</em> on Wednesday, then <em>again</em> on Sunday).</p>
<p><strong>If you're mulling over getting into  affiliate marketing or video marketing, act now.</strong></p>
<p>For now, the price is ludicriously  low when you consider the value on offer...</p>
<p><strong>But like I say, the price increases at the end of TODAY.</strong></p>
