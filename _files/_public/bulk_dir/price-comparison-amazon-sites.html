<p> <strong>I <em>wish</em> I'd thought of this...</strong></p>
<p>My buddy Dan  just released a new software - <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It's a <u> new website builder</u>... for   affiliates... but with a TWIST!</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Simply launch the software and you get a DFY affiliate website, so you can...</p>
<p>&#8226; Start   generating  commissions from <u>Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, Walmart + more</u>...</p>
<p><strong>BUT -- here's where what makes this tool <u>so  special</u>...</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<h2><strong>  ProductName Is <u><em>ALL</em></u> About  <u><em>Price Comparison Sites</em></u> which = Insane Conversions</strong></h2>
<p>And here's why this is so  <em>profitable</em>...</p>
<p>Rather than try to <em>convince</em> people to buy a product...</p>
<p>You simply <u>insert</u> yourself at the last minute and &quot;swipe&quot; your commission on the checkout page!</p>
<p> <strong>People search for &quot;product name&quot; <u>just before they buy</u> - looking for the best possible price, then...</strong></p>
<p>ProductName ranks you for these keywords with <u>DoneForYou 100% original content</u> created and posted to your site <u>DAILY</u>!</p>
<p><strong>So, your auto-article appears with the price comparison, and <u>your affiliate links</u> for the best deals...</strong></p>
<p><em>You're simply showing visitors what they want, across <u>Amazon, AliExpress, eBay, Nike, Target, Walmart</u> &amp; more</em>, so...</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:  you get FREE <u> buyer traffic that's insanely targeted.</u></strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Are people searching for 1000s of these products daily? <u>Heck yes</u>.</p>
<p>&#8226; Are these searches insanely targeted (think $5+ per click)? <u>Yes</u>.</p>
<p>&#8226; Is competition low for these keywords? <u>Absolutely</u>.</p>
<p>&#8226; With ProductName, it's all done for you! <u>Insane</u>!</p>
<p>Getting traffic &amp; &quot;finding buyers&quot; was always the <em>tricky part</em> of being an Amazon affiliate, but now...</p>
<p><strong>This new website builder does all of this <u>automatically</u>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>And with <u>daily content</u> &amp; <u>daily products</u>, you don't even need to worry about content generation!</strong></p>
<p>You can check out a 12 minute demo of the site, and a full explanation of how this clever new method works here:</p>
<h2><a href="https://site.com">Click Here - Profit As An Amazon Affiliate - With Price Comparison + Buyer Traffic</a><br>
</h2>
<p>Oh, and one more thing...</p>
<p>It's a great software tool,  so I've created an awesome $297 value bonus package...</p>
<h2>ProductName - Your $297 Bonus Offer</h2>
<p>Simply <a href="https://site.com">click here</a> and order ProductName (before the price increase  tonight).</p>
<p>As well as the core software (which is discounted today only), you'll get instant access to all of this:</p>
<p>InsertBonuses</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to hold this bonus pack forever, but it's from Dan, the creator of <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a>.</p>
<p><strong>He's allowed me to guarantee access to all these bonuses <u>until midnight Eastern tonight</u>.</strong></p>
<p>After that, it depends on how many we have sold (and we expect these to sell very quickly).</p>
<p>OK, so here's how you can claim your $297 Bonus Pack and build your first &quot;price comparison&quot; Amazon Affiliate Site:</p>

NOTE: You Will Also Get Instant Access To My Bonus Package</h2>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>YOURNAME
</p>
<p>P.S. I'm loving this idea - &quot;Price Compairon + Amazon + Google = Buyer Commissions&quot;... Clever!</p>
<p>But be aware that the price of ProductName increases every few hours...</p>
<p>So you have a short window to <a href="https://site.com">start getting Amazon commissions &amp; Google buyer traffic with coupon sites!</a><br>
