<p> {!name_fix}  -    Amazon&#8482; + Weirdness = Free Facebook&#8482; Traffic</p>
<p>{!name_fix},</p>
<p> <strong>I <em>wish</em> I'd thought of this...</strong></p>
<p>My buddy   just released a new WordPress plugin &amp; theme - <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It's a <u> new website builder</u>... for Amazon affiliates... but with a TWIST!</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Simply install the WP plugin, import Amazon products, and...</p>
<p>&#8226; Start   generating Amazon commissions from <u>256 million products</u>...</p>
<p><strong>BUT -- here's where what makes this tool <u>so  special</u>...</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<h2><strong>  NoveltySiteBuilder Is <u><em>ALL</em></u> About Promoting <u><em>WEIRD</em> Products</u> on Amazon</strong></h2>
<p>For example, you could promote &quot;finger covers for eating chips&quot; (yeah, <a href="https://site.com">it's a thing</a>)</p>
<p> <strong>People love sharing these kinds of weird products on Amazon - so you get FREE <u>viral traffic on Facebook</u></strong><u></u></p>
<p>&#8226; Do people share these products? <u>Heck yes</u>.</p>
<p>&#8226; Do they click through, out of curiosity? <u>Yes</u>.</p>
<p> &#8226; Do people then buy these products? Erm... <u>No</u>. </p>
<p>&#8226;<strong> Does that matter? <u>Heck no</u>!</strong> And here's why...</p>
<p>What matters is...</p>
<p>...</p>
<h2><u>You've just cookied that person</u>, and all their friends, with an Amazon affiliate cookie!</h2>
<p><strong>Then, when they return back to Amazon in 24 hours (like everyone does) and buy something - anything - you get a commission.</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the great things with Amazon - <u>you get paid for everything someone buys on the site</u> (not just what you promoted).</p>
<p>Getting traffic &amp; &quot;dropping the cookie&quot; was always the tricky part of being an Amazon affiliate, but now...</p>
<p><strong>This new WP theme does both automatically. Right in the middle of the holiday season!</strong></p>
<p>You can check out a demo of the site, and a full explanation of how it works here:</p>
<h2><a href="https://site.com">Click Here - Profit As An Amazon Affiliate - With WEIRD Products + Facebook Traffic</a><br>
</h2>
<p>Oh, and one more thing...</p>
<p>It's a great software tool,  so I've created an awesome $197 value bonus package...</p>
<h2>NoveltySiteBuilder - Your $197 Bonus Offer</h2>
<p>Simply <a href="https://site.com">click here</a> and order NoveltySiteBuilder (before the price increase  tonight).</p>
<p>As well as the core software (which is discounted this week only), you'll get instant access to all of this:</p>
<p>InsertBonuses</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to hold this bonus pack forever, but it's mostly from  the creator of <a href="https://site.com">NoveltySiteBuilder</a>.</p>
<p><strong>He's allowed me to guarantee access to all these bonuses <u>until midnight Eastern tonight</u>.</strong></p>
<p>After that, it depends on how many we have sold (and we expect these to sell very quickly).</p>
<p>OK, so here's how you can claim your $197 Bonus Pack and build your first &quot;viral&quot; Amazon Affiliate Site:</p>
<h2><a href="https://site.com">Click Here to Get Free Viral Traffic With Amazon Affiliate Sites +Weird Products</a><br>
NOTE: You Will Also Get Instant Access To My Bonus Package</h2>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>YOURNAME
</p>
<p>P.S. I'm loving this idea - &quot;Weird + Amazon + Facebook = Commissions&quot;. Clever</p>
<p>But be aware that the price of NoveltySiteBuilder increases every few hours...</p>
<p>So you have a short window to <a href="https://site.com">start getting Amazon commissions &amp; Facebook traffic with weirdo products!</a><br>
