</h2>
<p>Now, I'm sure you've heard the hype about <em>BitCoins</em>...</p>
<p><strong>But... 2023 introduced something even <u>WEIRDER</u>...</strong></p>
<p>I'm talking about &quot;<u>NFTs</u>&quot;...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Presenting: The  &quot;NFT&quot; - $<u>69 Million</u> For Some Pixels</h2>
<p>See...</p>
<p><strong>NFT's are a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; digital artwork...</strong></p>
<p><strong>An &quot;e-picture&quot; that will never be repeated.</strong></p>
<p><em>If <u>BitCoin &amp; collectables</u> had a baby, this would be it!</em></p>
<p>Now.. the reason I like NFTs <u>ISN'T</u> that they're huge (over $<u>1 billion</u> traded).</p>
<p><strong>Or that they are changing hands  for  $<u>69 million</u> at   Sothebys...</strong></p>
<p>No, the reason I like NFTs, is...</p>
<p><strong>They're a <u>GREAT</u> way to take coins... from people who already have LOTS!</strong></p>
<p>People swimming in coins - who think nothing of dropping $<u>65k</u> on a Lebron-GIF...</p>
<p><strong>I've said it before... BitCoin is great... just not if <u>you</u> have to spend $<u>50k</u> to buy a single coin.</strong></p>
<p>But, imagine if there was a way to tap right into the &quot;<u>BitCoin whales</u>&quot;...</p>
<p><strong>Insert your hand <u>deep</u> into their  gullet &amp; extract some of <u>their</u> coins...</strong></p>
<p><em>And do it by quickly selling them a picture of a zombie-cat - by some Internet unknown...</em></p>
<p><u>Imagine</u>: when the neighbors ask if you &quot;crowd-funded&quot; the new extension - and you reply...</p>
<p><em>&quot;No. I sold some  Reddit trader a Photoshopped picture of Putin&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>These NFT sales are simply off the charts...</strong></p>
<p><em>But isn't that a clear sign you want to be on the <u>seller</u> side of things?</em></p>
<p>And do it now, while the trend is so <u>HOT</u>?</p>
<p><strong>If you agree it's worth a look, then grab your shovel and...</strong></p>
