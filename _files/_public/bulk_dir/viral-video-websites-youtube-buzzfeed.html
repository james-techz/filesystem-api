<h2>ProductName  - Your $397 Bonus Offer</h2>

<p>As well as the core software, you'll get instant access to all of this:</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to hold this bonus pack forever, but much of it is from  the creator of <a href="https://site.com">ProductName</a>.</p>
<p><strong>He's allowed me to guarantee access to all these bonuses <u>until midnight Eastern tonight</u> (about 12 hours).</strong></p>
<p>After that, it depends on how many we have sold (and we expect these to sell very quickly).</p>
<p><strong>Oh.. and remember that the price of ProductName increases forever - tonight...</strong></p>
